# NeuralNet_fromScratch

The following repository contains a basic implementation of neural networks from scratch in python and C++. The implementation is done to get a better undersatanding of all the modules of training a basic deep learning model involving forward pass, backward pass, gradient calculation, model intialisation etc.
